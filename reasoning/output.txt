Okay, so I need to figure out what 1 raised to the power of 2^(235423523) is. Hmm, let's start by recalling some basic exponent rules. I remember that any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, but here the exponent is 2^(235423523), which is a really big number. Wait, but 1 raised to any power is always 1, right? Let me make sure I'm not confusing this with other rules.

So, the expression is 1^(2^(235423523)). Let's break it down. The base is 1, and the exponent is 2 raised to 235423523. Now, regardless of what the exponent is, as long as the base is 1, the result should still be 1. Is there any case where 1 raised to a power isn't 1? I don't think so. For example, 1^1 is 1, 1^2 is 1, 1^100 is 1, and so on. So even if the exponent is a huge number like 2^(235423523), which is an astronomically large number, 1 raised to that power should still be 1.

Wait, but maybe I should check if there's a special case where exponents behave differently. For instance, 0^0 is undefined, but that's a different case. Here, the base is 1, not 0. So, unless there's some mathematical trick or a different interpretation of the exponent, I don't see why it would change.

Let me think again. The exponent here is 2^(235423523). That's a very large exponent, but since the base is 1, the result is still 1. So, regardless of how big the exponent is, 1 raised to any power is 1. Therefore, the answer should be 1.

I guess another way to think about it is using logarithms or properties of exponents, but I don't think that's necessary here. The key point is that 1 to any power is 1. So, even if the exponent is a huge number, the result remains 1. Therefore, 1^(2^(235423523)) is 1.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1}
</think>

To determine the value of \(1^{(2^{235423523})}\), we start by recalling the basic property of exponents: any number raised to any power is 1 if the base is 1. 

The expression given is \(1^{(2^{235423523})}\). Here, the base is 1, and the exponent is \(2^{235423523}\), which is a very large number. However, regardless of the size of the exponent, raising 1 to any power will always result in 1. 

This is because the number 1 multiplied by itself any number of times will always remain 1. Therefore, even with an exponent as large as \(2^{235423523}\), the result of \(1^{(2^{235423523})}\) is still 1.
